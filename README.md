# Transfer Learning
Transfer learning assignment from Machine Learning class @ UFMG


# Jupyter Notebook
In this repo, You'll find both a jupyter notebook and a regular python scipt. You can choose which to use, given your application. However, the jupyter notebook
contains analisys regarding the methods used, along with code and graphs.

# Graphs Examples
Here are some examples of graphs created using code in this repository

### Each Model
For every model created, we can compare accuracy and loss for train/test:
![Train/Test Acc](/images/traintestacc.png "Acc Graph")
![Train/Test Loss](/images/traintestloss.png "Loss Graph")


Also, for every model, a Acc/Loss comparison graph is created:

![Test Acc/Loss](/images/testaccloss.png "Test Acc/Loss")


### All Models
Also, we plot graphs comparing all models. For train/test, we plot accuracy and loss for all models, as examplified below:

![Train Acc All](/images/trainaccall.png "All Train Acc")
![Train Loss ALl](/images/trainlossall.png "All Train Loss")
![Test Acc All](/images/testaccall.png "All Test Acc")
![Test Loss All](/images/testlossall.png "All Loss Acc")
