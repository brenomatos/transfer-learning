# Jupyter Notebook
In this repo, You'll find both a jupyter notebook and a regular python scipt. You can choose which to use, given your application. However, the jupyter notebook
contains analisys regarding the methods used, along with code and graphs.


# Graphs Examples
Here are some examples of graphs created using code in this repository

For every model created, we can compare accuracy and loss for train/test:
